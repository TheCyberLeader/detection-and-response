# network-horizon-mapping
🌐 Network topology analysis and security posture review through the lens of resilience and visibility.

**Project Title**: *Mapping Network Security Posture and Visibility Gaps*

**Project Introduction**: This project required mapping the logical and physical network structure of a small organization to assess its exposure. I identified high-risk zones and evaluated the effectiveness of existing segmentation and access policies.

**Modeling and Evaluation**: Basic network mapping tools were used alongside visual topology diagrams. Evaluation was conducted using CIA triad and exposure scoring.

**Conclusion**: Key recommendations included improved segmentation, firewall rule refinement, and monitoring coverage. Next steps include simulating threat scenarios for attack path validation.
